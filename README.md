## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Utility Library

### What I learned

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind provided a huge improvement to my workload and developer experience. I love working out of one file, rather than two (html and css).

I also experiemented with overlapping content using grid instead of positiong relative or position absolute.

Finally, I learned how to create shapes using SVGs and bring them into the page in a responsive manner.

Great project!

### Continued development

Keep working with Tailwind CSS and improve development speed.

### Useful resources

-  [Tailwind CSS Cheatsheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/) - Nice reference, particularly being my first time using these utilities.
